    through meadows misty in the twilight. 
A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the 
breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.

    I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of 
other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, 
streams, or the West wind.

      Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an 
avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. 
Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: 
the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had 
accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there 
was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The 
stuttering sparks of the music kept on. 
    </p>
    <p class="puzzle">
But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a 
lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by 
the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the 
moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me.

       He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.

No doubt you want to see the garden?"

Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.

"The garden?"

  "The garden of forking paths."

Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:

<P class="puzzle">
 "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."

<P class="puzzle">
 "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."

The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house, 
we went into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized some 
large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was 
edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. They had never been 
printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also 
a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which 
our potters copied from the Persians . . .

    Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said, 
remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. 
There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, he
